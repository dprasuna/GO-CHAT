# Step 1: Use Node.js to install dependencies and build the React app
FROM node:18 AS build

WORKDIR /app
COPY package.json package-lock.json ./
RUN npm install
COPY . ./
RUN npm run build

# Step 2: Use nginx to serve the built React app
FROM nginx:alpine

# Copy the build files from the previous stage to the nginx container
COPY --from=build /app/build /usr/share/nginx/html

# Expose port 3000 (this will be the port the frontend is accessible from)
EXPOSE 3000

# Run nginx to serve the app
CMD ["nginx", "-g", "daemon off;"]
